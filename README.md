code and data from Gureckis &amp; Goldstone (2009)

The original code for this project was all analyzed using Mathematica.  Interestingly, back when we started this it was not such a popular dataset for textbook data-analysis and so had to write scripts to crawl and parse the SSA babyname website.  Anyway, as part of a few weeks of "skill updating" I recreated all of the graphs of the paper using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.  For the most part everything comes out perfectly the same.  I didn't go through the fits of the MILEY model because they were largely supportive of the more empirically-driven data analysis and the model fitting itself is a complex issue (involving multiple maximum likelihood searches, many local minima, etc...).  However, this is both a relief and was a fun way to test my Python data analysis skills.
